== Project Info ==

The goal of the Creovel project is to encourage rapid application development. Based on the Rails approach, a
variation of the classic MVC design paradigm, a 'model' manages business logic execution, the presentation logic
resides in the 'view', and the 'controller' handles the processes & responses to actions that may invoke changes
on the model and view.

Creovel also allows us (the development team) to give back to the open-source community.
